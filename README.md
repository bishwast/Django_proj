# Title: Python with Django for Web Development

## Project Description:
    - The repository includes a Python Crash Coding practices which can help anyone in reviewing the Python Programming Language in terms of Web Development. In addition,
    repository also contains coding on how Django can be used in combination with Python to create a backend code that supports default database as well as an option. 
    to support an external database like MySQL, SQL, and PostgreSQL.
    
### What this application does?
    - This application uses a bootstrap free web template which is customized to help user log in and log out. In the backend, the application stores the user input in 
    PostgreSQL Database. 
    - Dynamic URL routing is demonstrated in Django in a way where each rendered POST is stored as a counter in its own html page so that each user will get their own
    dynamic page when the login is successful with a custom message per their credentials. 
    - For incorrect login the website provides an option to go back to homepage '/' to log back in if credentials are incorrect, or to create a new login profile.
    - Application demonstrates how a superuser can be created in Django; for example, an Admin, so that if Dango's default database is used, the admin can add into 
    database from the admin profile itself. 
    
### Why I used the technologies I used?
    - So that I can make the web application dynamic, secure user input for cross site vulnerabilities protection and have a choice to store the entire database in 
    external database like PostgreSQL.
